	\section{Concept}
	\subsection{Idea}
	The general idea is to create an application that eases team-challenges. Challenges consist of a mapping of several disciplines (e.g. running, biking, ...) to corresponding points per km, a defined goal how many points should be collected and a deadline. Users can use the app for tracking their activities which automatically are stored in a database and see the current status of the challenge.
